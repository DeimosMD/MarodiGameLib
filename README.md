# Marodi Game Library
## Intro
Marodi functions as more of an engine than a framework. While using it, update/draw methods are written by the game dev, and then called by the library when needed. Marodi as well handles physics, collison, and camera scrolling.
### Starting to code with the library
```
import control.Game;

class App extends Game {

    App() {
        super();
    }
}
```
