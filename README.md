# Marodi Game Library
## Intro
Marodi functions as more of an engine than a framework. 
While using it, update/draw methods are written by the game dev, 
and then called by the library when needed. 
Marodi as well handles physics, collision, and camera scrolling.
### Starting to code with the library
To utilize the library one must create a _Game_ object, 
by either creating an instance of the 
_Game_ class directly or creating a subclass and creating an instance of that. 
Creating a _Game_ subclass is not necessary for the basic program made in
this tutorial but is good practice because it is used a lot in more
complex games.
Below is an example of a _Game_ subclass.
Creating sprites is as well practically necessary for any game. 
Below also an example of how to make a basic _Player_ sprite class.
```
package org.game;

import marodi.control.Game;

class App extends Game {

    Player player = new Player();

    App() {
        getCurrentWorld().add(player);
    }
}
```
```
package org.game;

import marodi.component.Sprite;
import marodi.control.Game;
import marodi.control.KeyHandler;

import java.awt.*;

class Player extends Sprite {

    @Override
    public void start(Game game) {
        setResistance(0.1f, game);
        x = 500;
        y = 500;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw(Game game) {
        game.camera.drawRect(50,50, new Color(255, 255, 255), this);
    }

    @Override
    public void update(Game game) {
        double acc = 100;
        if (game.keyHandler.isPressed(KeyHandler.OF_UP))
            velocityY += acc * game.getFrameTime();
        if (game.keyHandler.isPressed(KeyHandler.OF_DOWN))
            velocityY -= acc * game.getFrameTime();
        if (game.keyHandler.isPressed(KeyHandler.OF_LEFT))
            velocityX -= acc * game.getFrameTime();
        if (game.keyHandler.isPressed(KeyHandler.OF_RIGHT))
            velocityX += acc * game.getFrameTime();
    }
}
```
Now to launch the game, we must create an instance of the _App_ class 
and call its _launch()_ method.
```
package org.game;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        App game = new App();
        game.launch();
    }
}
```
Well, How does this work? First off, the _start_ method sets the position to 
(500, 500) and sets the resistance of
the sprites to 0.1 to slow it down by 10% every frame. The _draw_ method calls
a method from the camera object to draw a 50x50 white rectangle at the position
of the sprite. And lastly, the _update_ method checks if specific sets of keys are
being pressed to determine how to accelerate by changing the velocity by the
acceleration multiplied by the time the most recent frame took.
